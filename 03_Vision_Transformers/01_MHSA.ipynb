    "MULTI HEAD SELF ATTENTION\n",
    " - self-attention computes relationships between elements in a sequence — like how patch A attends to patch B\n",
    " - instead of just one set of attention weights, MHSA splits it into multiple “heads”, each learning different relationships\n",
    " - they all look at the same input, but each sees different patterns\n",
    " - Each head looks at all patches, but learns to focus on different visual cues:\n",
    "\n",
    "        | Head 1 | → center of object\n",
    "        | Head 2 | → edges\n",
    "        | Head 3 | → object boundaries\n",
    "        | Head 4 | → spatial layout\n",
    "        | ... |\n",
    "        | Head 12| → fine-grained textures\n",
    "\n",
